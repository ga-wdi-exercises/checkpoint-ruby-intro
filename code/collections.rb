# collections

# 1. Create a variable `point1` and assign it a hash representing a coordinate with keys `:x` and `:y` which have integer values

point1 = {
  :x => "38.9072 N",
  :y => "77.0369 W",
}


# 2. Print the y value

print.point(y)

# 3. Make an array, `points`, that includes `point1` and two more points (`points.length` should be 3)

points.length = {
  ':x' = '28.9072 N'
  ':y' =  '47.0369 W'
}

points = 'point1' + 'ponts.length'

# 4. Use `.each` to print the y value of each point

print points(y).each

# 5. Use `.each_with_index` and string interpolation to print for each point "The point at index <index> has coordinates {x: <x-val>, y: <y-val>}"

print "The point at index <index> has coordinates {x: <x-val>, y: <y-val>}"

# 6. Create an array and call it `distances_from_origin` by mapping over the points with the `.map` method and returning the distance between the point and origin, (0,0).
# Distance from origin can be found with the equation `distance_from_origin = Math.sqrt(x_val ** 2 + y_val ** 2)`

puts distance_from_origin = {
